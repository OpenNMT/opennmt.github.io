OpenNMT is used as provided in <a href="https://demo-pnmt.systran.net/">production</a> by major translation providers.
The system is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend, while
maintaining efficiency and state-of-the-art translation accuracy.

Features include:

* Simple <a href="Guide">general-purpose interface</a>, requires only source/target files.
* Speed and memory optimizations for high-performance <a href="http://opennmt.net//Guide/#parallel-training">multi-GPU</a> training.
* Includes a dependency-free C++ <a href="https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate/">translator</a> for model deployment.
* Latest <a href="http://opennmt.net//Guide/#additional-features">research</a> features to improve translation performance.
* Pretrained <a href="Models">models</a> available for several language pairs.
* Extensions to allow other sequence generation tasks such as <a href="Models">summarization</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opennmt/im2text">image-to-text</a> generation.
* Active open <a href="http://forum.opennmt.net">community</a> welcoming both academic and industrial requests and contributions.
